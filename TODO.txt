Create groups ->

Then home screen, three panes, left pane is user profile & settings, middle pane is swiping, right pane is groups & chats. 

Left pane 
Endpoint requries -> Query GET USER DETAILS 
                    Update -> Update settings... at this stage what settings will a user have (dark mode?)
                    Update -> Delete account

Middle pane 
                    Query -> Get currently swiping in (to show correct panes)
                    Mutation -> Update currently swiping in (when a user changes groups)
                    Query -> Get list of movies/TV shows by preferences (e.g. only select movies/TV shows the user might like)
                    Mutation -> User has liked a show
                    Mutation -> User has disliked a show
                    Query -> Preload shows which other member of the group has liked for fast notifications (see TRPC examples for this)


Right pane 
                    Query -> Get all groups 
                    Query -> Get all friends
                    TBC WEBSOCKETS for chat FUNCTIONALITY
                    Mutation -> Remove from group 
                    Query -> Get all group likes 


BUGS: 

    Sign up flow:
        User can send themselves a friend request -> remove user from list
        Genres appear in random order -> filter by alpha
        User cannot update username to their own username


    Schema change all ID to Id
