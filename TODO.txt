CURRENT:

    - Update Dashboard
        - Create a user settings modal
    


- Will need to add a job that runs to check for changes to IDs (names to not change, so could do a check there and then run the check)

BUGS: 
    Sign up flow:
        Doesn't direct to dashboard
    Dashboard:
        Doesn't default to colormode dark.
    Tindercards:
        If you swipe in a group on your own you create a load of matches
        The trailer modal isn't working


Color Mode => change font color on friend add links 

IMPLICIT MANY TO MANY does not support referntial actions, 

Need some further logic to handle account deletion for user groups e.g. if user deleted is usergroup admin && they are the only admin then delete the group.
