CURRENT:

Need to review routers to ensure we're not sending sensitive data to the client
- Perhaps make a UI USER Type which just has the core data needed for UI elements (userName, Image etc)
- Friends is broken, I should add a friend to a sub table of friends when a request is accepted, not add them if declined and have a method to remove them once accepted. 
- This is also true for groups.


- Will need to add a job that runs to check for changes to IDs (names to not change, so could do a check there and then run the check)

1) SET UP PROD ENV VARIABLES - NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT HOW DEPLOYING TO VERCEL WORKS
2) ADD CUSTOM DOMAIN FROM GODADDY - DONE
3) ADD NEW USER SIGN UP FLOW  
4) ADD GROUPS
5) GET LIKES WORKING 
6) INTERGRATE TMDB CATEGORIES ETC
7) Abstract UI components for reuse


Create groups ->

Then home screen, three panes, left pane is user profile & settings, middle pane is swiping, right pane is groups & chats. 

Left pane 
Endpoint requries -> Query GET USER DETAILS 
                    Update -> Update settings... at this stage what settings will a user have (dark mode?)
                    Update -> Delete account

Middle pane 
                    Query -> Get currently swiping in (to show correct panes)
                    Mutation -> Update currently swiping in (when a user changes groups)
                    Query -> Get list of movies/TV shows by preferences (e.g. only select movies/TV shows the user might like)
                    Mutation -> User has liked a show
                    Mutation -> User has disliked a show
                    Query -> Preload shows which other member of the group has liked for fast notifications (see TRPC examples for this)


Right pane 
                    Query -> Get all groups 
                    Query -> Get all friends
                    TBC WEBSOCKETS for chat FUNCTIONALITY
                    Mutation -> Remove from group 
                    Query -> Get all group likes 


BUGS: 

    Sign up flow:
        User can send themselves a friend request -> remove user from list
        Genres appear in random order -> filter by alpha
        User cannot update username to their own username


    Schema change all ID to Id

    No genres Found on sign up screen 1


Questions for Rob:

So, now I'm using the API, I want TRPC to do the client side stuff, but I want a second server to do some checks on the DB. True backend gubbins.
The checks will be 1) Does the 

Actually no, I only need to check and add an item if it has been liked. Much less effort. 

We still might need something like this to run regular jobs to check IDs have not changed. This will be implemented later.
